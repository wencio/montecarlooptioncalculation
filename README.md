# montecarlooptioncalculation
 This code employs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the price of a European call option, taking into account various parameters and configurations defined in QuantLib.
Global Description of the Code:
This code uses the QuantLib library in Python to calculate the price of a European call option using Monte Carlo simulations. Various option and underlying stochastic process parameters are defined, necessary QuantLib objects are configured, and simulations are run to estimate the option's price.

Line-by-Line Description:

1. We import the QuantLib library as `ql`.

3. We define the option parameters, such as the underlying asset price (`spot_price`), strike price (`strike_price`), risk-free interest rate (`interest_rate`), volatility (`volatility`), time to maturity (`time_to_maturity`), and the number of Monte Carlo simulations (`num_simulations`).

6. We create a date object (`today`) representing the current date.

9. We set the evaluation date in QuantLib (`ql.Settings.instance().evaluationDate`) to match `today`.

12. We define handles for the underlying asset price, interest rate, and volatility. Handles are objects that allow interaction with the underlying values and are used in constructing other objects.

15. We create a European option object with the specified payoff function and expiration date.

18. We define a random number generator using the Sobol method, which will be used in the Monte Carlo simulations. We configure the number of paths and samples it will generate.

21. We initialize a `ql.SequenceStatistics` object that will be used to store statistics from the simulations.

24. We create the Monte Carlo pricing engine (`ql.MCEuropeanEngine`) by configuring the random sequence generator, price, interest rate, and volatility handles, and specifying the number of paths, the `ql.SequenceStatistics` object, and other parameters.

30. We assign the pricing engine to the option.

33. We calculate the option price (`option_price`) by calling the `NPV()` method of the option.

36. We print the calculated price of the option using Monte Carlo simulations.

In summary, this code employs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the price of a European call option, taking into account various parameters and configurations defined in QuantLib.
